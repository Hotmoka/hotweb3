/**
 * Base58 is a way to encode Bitcoin addresses (or arbitrary data) as alphanumeric strings.
 * <p>
 * Note that this is not the same base58 as used by Flickr, which you may find referenced around the Internet.
 * <p>
 * Satoshi explains: why base-58 instead of standard base-64 encoding?
 * <ul>
 * <li>Don't want 0OIl characters that look the same in some fonts and
 *     could be used to create visually identical looking account numbers.</li>
 * <li>A string with non-alphanumeric characters is not as easily accepted as an account number.</li>
 * <li>E-mail usually won't line-break if there's no punctuation to break at.</li>
 * <li>Doubleclicking selects the whole number as one word if it's all alphanumeric.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * However, note that the encoding/decoding runs in O(n&sup2;) time, so it is not useful for large data.
 * <p>
 * The basic idea of the encoding is to treat the data bytes as a large number represented using
 * base-256 digits, convert the number to be represented using base-58 digits, preserve the exact
 * number of leading zeros (which are otherwise lost during the mathematical operations on the
 * numbers), and finally represent the resulting base-58 digits as alphanumeric ASCII characters.
